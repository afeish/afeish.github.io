## [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return *the **maximum** profit you can achieve*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

## Analysis

​	The problem can be divided into the small problems. Suppose we have the definition of  `dfs(i,j)` which stands for the **maximum** profit you can achieve at day `i`, `j` can be `0` or `1` which stands for not holding the stock and holding the stock·，,then we can deduce that 

$$
dfs(i,j) =  \begin{cases}
max(df(i-1,0), dfs(i-1,1) + s[i]) & \text{j == 0}\\
max(dfs(i-1,1), dfs(i-1,1) - s[i]) & \text{j == 1} \\

0 		& \text{i == -1 and j == 0}\\ 
-\infty & \text{i == -1 and j == -1} \\
\end{cases}
$$

​	For example, we have a sequence `[7,1,5,3,6,4]` and current end index  `i` is `0`, then `dfs(0, 0)` is 

$$
dfs(0, 0) =  max(dfs(-1,0), dfs(-1,1) + 7) = 0 \\
dfs(0, 1) = max(dfs(-1,1), dfs(-1,0) - 7) = -7
$$

​	So the max profit we can get on day 1 is `max(0, -7)=0`	



​	We can also deduce the DP function:
$$
f[i][j] = \begin{cases} 
max(f[i-1][0], f[i-1][1] + s[i]) & \text{j == 0} \\
max(f[i-1][1], f[i-1][0] - s[i]) & \text{j == 1} \\
0 & \text{i == -1 and j == 0}\\
-\infty & \text{i == -1 and j == 1} \\
\end{cases}
$$

$$
f[i+1][j] = \begin{cases} 
max(f[i][0], f[i][1] + s[i]) & \text{j == 0} \\
max(f[i][1], f[i][0] - s[i]) & \text{j == 1} \\
\end{cases}
$$

## Solutions 



### 1. DFS way

```py
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        @cache
        def dfs(i, j):
            if i < 0:
                return -inf if j else 0
            if j:
                return max(dfs(i-1, 1), dfs(i-1,0) - prices[i])
            else:
                return max(dfs(i-1, 0), dfs(i-1,1) + prices[i])
       	return dfs(n-1,0)
```

Input:   `[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]`

output:

```shell
4
```

#### Complexity

- Time complexity: ( O(n) ), where ( n ) is the length of the array.
- Space complexity: ( O(n) ), where ( n) is the length of the array.

### 2.  DP

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        f = [[0]*2 for _ in range(n+1)]
        f[0][0] = 0
        f[0][1] = -inf
        for i, p in enumerate(prices):
            f[i+1][0] =  max(f[i][0], f[i][1] + p)
            f[i+1][1] =  max(f[i][1], f[i][0] - p)
        return f[n][0]
```

Input:   `[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]`

output:

```shell
4
```

#### Complexity

- Time complexity: ( O(n) ), where ( n ) is the length of the array.
- Space complexity: ( O(n) ), where ( n) is the length of the array.

### 3.  DP one dim

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        f0 = 0
        f1 = -inf
        for p in prices:
            new_f0 = max(f0, f1+p) # preserve the old one
            f1 = max(f1, f0-p)
            f0 = new_f0
        return f0
```

Input:   `[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]`

output:

```shell
4
```
#### Complexity

- Time complexity: ( O(n) ), where ( n ) is the length of the array.
- Space complexity: ( O(1 ), where ( n) is the length of the array.
