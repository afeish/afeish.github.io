## [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the length of the longest **strictly increasing*** ***subsequence***

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

 

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?



## Analysis

​	The problem can be divided into the small problems. Suppose we have the definition of  `dfs(i)` which stands for the longest increasing subsequence, then we can deduce that 

$$
dfs(i) = max(df(j)) + 1  \;\;\;\; \text{ s[i] < s[j]}
$$

​	For example, we have a sequence `[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]` and current end index  `i` is `7`, then `dfs(7)` is 

$$
dfs(7) =  max(dfs(0), dfs(1), dfs(2), dfs(3), dfs(4), dfs(5)) + 1 
$$

​	We can also deduce the DP function:

$$
f[i] =  max(f[j], f[i]) + 1  \;\;\;\;\text{s[i] < s[j]}
$$


## Solutions 



### 1. DFS way

```py
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        @cache
        def dfs(i):
            res = 0
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    return max(res, dfs(j))
            return res + 1
        ans = 0 
        for i in range(n):
            ans = max(ans, dfs(i))
        return ans
```

Input:   `[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]`

output:

```shell
4
```

#### Complexity

- Time complexity: ( O(n^2) ), where ( n ) is the length of the array.
- Space complexity: ( O(n) ), where ( n) is the length of the array.

### 2.  DP

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        f = [0] * (n)
        for i in range(n):
        	for j in range(i):
                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    f[i] = max(f[i], f[j])
            f[i] += 1
        return max(f)
```

Input:   `[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]`

output:

```shell
4
```

#### Complexity

- Time complexity: ( O(n^2) ), where ( n ) is the length of the array.
- Space complexity: ( O(n) ), where ( n) is the length of the array.
